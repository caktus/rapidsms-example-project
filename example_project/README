This is an example of a RapidSMS project, as it might be deployed
in-country. When development settles down a bit, the rapidsms package
can be bundled into a deb, rpm, .tar.gz (or whatever), and installed
into site-packages. For now, it is a submodule.

The RapidSMS repo also contains submodules of its own, so don't forget
to `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` those, too.
